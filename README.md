## 🔗 Overview

**SolGraph is the first AI workflow protocol built for Solana.** It enables developers to compose, execute, and verify AI-powered workflows on-chain with unparalleled speed and transparency. By combining **LangGraph**'s dynamic AI workflows with **Solana's high-performance infrastructure**, SolGraph provides an **open, modular, and trustless execution layer** for AI-driven applications.

### 🔥 Why SolGraph?

🚀 **On-Chain AI Execution** – AI workflows run verifiably on Solana, not in centralized black boxes.

🛠 **Modular & Composable** – AI components work like DeFi legos, enabling powerful, flexible execution.

⚡ **Solana-Powered Speed** – Execute AI workflows at high throughput and low latency.

🔍 **Verifiable & Transparent** – AI decisions can be audited and proven via ZK-powered mechanisms.

🌍 **Hybrid Compute** – Seamlessly bridge **on-chain state** with **off-chain GPU/TPU inference**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### **🛠 Build AI Workflows Like Smart Contracts**
SolGraph transforms AI pipelines into **composable execution graphs**, just like smart contracts:

```rust
// Deploy an AI-powered trading bot on Solana
#[solana_program]  
mod trading_flow {  
    fn execute(ctx: Context<Execute>) -> Result<()> {  
        let prices = fetch_pyth_data()?;       // On-Chain Data
        let signal = ai_model::predict(prices); // Off-Chain Inference
        execute_swap(&ctx, signal)?;            // On-Chain Execution
        Ok(())  
    }  
}  
```

### **🌎 Composable AI Modules**
AI workflows in SolGraph are built using **modular, reusable nodes**, such as:

- **LLM Nodes** – Chain-native execution of large language models.
- **Data Retrieval Nodes** – Fetch on-chain & off-chain datasets in real time.
- **Oracle Nodes** – Integrate AI workflows with financial & market data.
- **Autonomous Agent Nodes** – Create self-improving AI execution loops.

### **🔗 Verifiable AI Execution**
Every AI workflow executed on SolGraph can be **verified, audited, and proven**:

- **On-Chain Proofs** – AI outputs generate zk-SNARKs for verifiability.
- **Decentralized AI Nodes** – AI models run on trustless, permissionless networks.
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy** – AI models execute privately, without data leakage.
